graphs4good community.  In repy to Neo4j idea, we decided to share a neo4j Stock managment database

Goal:
Easy sharing stock managment between entities (medical or not)
or more simply medical resources sharing, availability announcement, second-hand product proposal.

use case:
"National management of strategic stocks of health products"
"National health threat response plans" 
An incoming scandal about wrong stock managment.


Core is already done, but this particular using need to be inproved.

First needing is real use case to define main caracteristics.
